        <p4>Fight Mechanics:</p4>

        <p>Demonic Gorilla's are a fairly tough opponent, but with some knowledge on their attack patterns you will be able to slay them with ease. First off, it is good to know that Demonic Gorillas will engage with either crush, ranged, or magic attacks.</p>
        <p>The best way to spot a crush attack is to step back a couple tiles from the gorilla to see if it runs towards you to close the gap, and if it does not, then you can safely say that the gorilla will attack with either ranged, or magic. If the attack is decided to be ranged or magic, keep the two tile distance between you and the gorilla and activate your magic prayer to start as there is no way to know whether or not the gorilla will attack with ranged or magic. (magic tends to hit more consistantly than ranged)</p>
        <p>If the first attack ends up being ranged, quickly switch to your range prayer to prevent any attacks from landing. Demonic Gorillas attack in sets of three if all damage to you was prevented; however, if an attack lands as you are switching to the appropriate prayer, the gorilla will keep attacking with the same style until three instances of damage have been negated.</p>
        <p>Repeat that process while maintaining the two tile gap so you know when to activate protect from melee. Demonic Gorillas will throw boulders at you occassionally while using ranged or magic and they can hit up to 40 damage. If you see a shadow under your feet and a boulder dropping from above, move off of that tile to avoid taking the hit.</p>
        <p>One last thing to note before taking on the Demonic Gorillas is that they can use protection prayers just like you. As soon as you walk into the caves you will notice that Demonic Gorillas unlike their Tormented Gorilla counterpart will have one of the three protection prayers above their head. When you attack the gorilla, you will need to switch weapons according to what they are praying.</p>
        <p>(ex. gorilla is praying melee, so you equip a ranged weapon to deal damage, then after taking 50 or more damage, the gorilla switches to ranged prayer, now you switch to a melee weapon.)</p>

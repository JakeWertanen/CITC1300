    <p>In league of legends, you can test your skill against the mightiest of opponents in ranked queue and fight your way to the top. There are nine ranks in the ranking system, each of which will be briefly described below:</p>

    <h4>Iron</h4><img src="images/iron.webp" alt="Iron">
    <p>Iron players lack mechanics and general knowledge of the game. The skill gap isnâ€™t that big from Iron to Bronze, and you should rank up quickly.</p>

    <h4>Bronze</h4><img src="images/bronze.webp" alt="Bronze">
    <p>Bronze players also lack mechanics and general knowledge of the game. Bronze players for the most part know how to abuse a lead which is what seperates bronze from iron.</p>
    
    <h4>Silver</h4><img src="images/silver.webp" alt="Silver">
    <p>Silver players are getting better with their general knowledge and can abuse a lead; however, silver players often throw leads by puting themselves in dangerous situations that are completely avoidable.</p>
    
    <h4>Gold</h4><img src="images/gold.webp" alt="Gold">
    <p>Gold players have decent general knowledge and are able to easily abuse a lead. Gold players have better mechanics than silver and below and are working on better vision placement and have decent map awareness.</p>
    
    <h4>Platinum</h4><img src="images/platinum.webp" alt="Platinum">
    <p>Platinum players have good general knowledge and solid mechanics and can almost always abuse a lead and push it further. Platinum players have good map awareness and decent vision control.</p>
    
    <h4>Diamond</h4><img src="images/diamond.webp" alt="Diamond">
    <p>Diamond players have excellent general knowledge and great mechanics. Diamond players have excellent vision control and map awareness and know how to push leads to victory!</p>
    
    <h4>Master</h4><img src="images/master.webp" alt="Master">
    <p>Master players make up the top 0.034% of players in ranked. These players are at the point where they need to refine their existing skills to climb higher on the ranked ladder.</p>
   
    <h4>Grandmaster</h4><img src="images/grandmaster.webp" alt="Grandmaster">
    <p>Grandmaster players make up the top 0.028% of players in ranked. These players are constantly trying to improve what they already know so they can one day make it to challenger.</p>
  
    <h4>Challenger</h4><img src="images/challenger.webp" alt="Challenger">
    <p>Challenger players make up the top 0.012% of players in ranked. These players have reached the highest rank in League of Legends. Congrats for reaching challenger if this is you!</p>
